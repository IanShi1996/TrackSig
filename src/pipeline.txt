# Creating phis from VCF files and jsons from PhyloWGS:
make_phis.sh (using exultant-pistachio/protocols/make-calibration-report/calc_ssm_phis.py)

# Create mutation counts from VCFs and phi files:
make_counts.sh (using getMutationTypes.pl  to make file with mutation contexts sorted by phis; using make_hundreds.py to extract hundreds; make_hundred_bootstrap.py to make bootstrapped counts from the mutation list to compute p-values)

# If we have mutation assignments to clusters, then they need to be sorted by phi
get_clusters_at_timepoints.R 

# Compute mutational signatures:
compute_mutational_signatures.R
